There is one main activity there which has a list view
Gets all the "stainfrom" column cursor
Lists  it, so as soon as you open the app, you see a list
<stainfrom> on <stainon>
like
oil on washable fabric

Still have to figure out how the image will be there, the layout used in the list view has the <Image> but i have to set it dynamically
the database has 6 columns

_id, stainfrom, stainon, img, needs, steps, notes

In the todo list, we have,
1. click listener on the list item click
2. new activity show, with the data from db, needs and steps
probably would use a webview, since the steps and needs column has <li> in them
3. set the images to show it
that would complete the minimum viable product
